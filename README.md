# Fieldwork Fill Station
This was My first ever mod for Farming Simulator 22 that was submitted to ModHub &amp; accepted on Aug 30, 2022, and as of the release of FS25, has over 277k downloads!

For FS25, I've updated the Fill Station to be everything that I've wanted, all in one mod. Both the normal _Fill Station_ and the _Free Fill Station_ also include a selling point for the same products underneath the spout. The _Fill Station Silo_ works as a normal silo for any product that it supports, as well as an trigger off to the side to pay to fill it with any amount of any supporting product.
